# Chest_xray_Project_4
We are Team Purple working on Project 4.  Our Team consists of four members:
Khali Baasandorj
Michael MacInnis
Jessica Chellapa
Julian Hahm

For Project 4, we are tasked to solve, analyze, or visualize a problem using machine learning (ML) with the other technologies weâ€™ve learned. We decided to figure out how Machine learning can assist in detecting Pneumonia. 

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens. It triggers inflammation in the alveoli, the tiny air sacs responsible for gas exchange, leading to fluid or pus accumulation and impaired respiratory function. The primary transmission route is through airborne droplets expelled during sneezing or coughing, while contact with contaminated surfaces also poses a risk.
